I put together a [collection of interesting datasets](https://idc9.github.io/stor390/data/collection.html) you can find online.

- **movies.csv** was collected by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel. For more information go to [http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.html](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.html)

- **imdb_5000.csv** is another data set of movie meta data scraped from imdb and [posted on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). It has slightly different columns than the previous movies data set.

- the MoMA data (**moma_art_jan2017.csv** and **moma_artists_jan2017.csv**) comes from the MoMA collection. For more information go to their github: https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection

- **unc_depts.csv** comes from the [News and Observer] (http://www.newsobserver.com/news/databases/public-salaries/) by way of [Ryan Thronburg's website](http://ryanthornburg.com/)

- **bison_orangecounty.csv** comes from [Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation](https://bison.usgs.gov/#home)

- **beauty_beast_raw.txt** and **beauty_clean_df.csv** are the raw text and a cleaned up version of the raw text of beauty and the beast. The original data set can be found TODO.

- **dubliners.txt** is the text of a collection of short stories by James Joyce. The original text file is from TODO.

# Artificial data sets

We use a couple made up data sets we generated to illustrate specific R skills. 

- **whales.csv** is a data set for [tidy data]()
- the data sets in the **joins** folders are toy data sets to practice joins.
