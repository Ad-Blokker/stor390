# Why this matters

- A lot of interesting data comes in the form of text. 

- Messy data often can be cleaned up by treating it as text and editing---for example a column that should be numeric but that has commas in it. 


# What you will learn
- Logic of regular expressions
- **Match** one string to another using a syntax called regular expressions
- **Extract** a pattern from a series of strings, such as removing the word 'man' from 'manimal' or 'mandible'
- **Replace** one string with another
- **Look-ahead** regular expressions, useful when you want to match one text pattern only if it comes before a second text pattern


# R can read
*GASTON: How can you read this? There's no pictures!* 

*BELLE: Well, some people use their imaginations.*

# Beauty and the beast text

http://www.fpx.de/fp/Disney/Scripts/




# First some tidy data

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr) # does not come with tidyverse
library(RColorBrewer)

# read in the cleaned beaut and the beast data frame
# see the .Rmd for the code that creates beauty_clean_df
beauty <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idc9/stor390/master/data/beauty_clean_df.csv')
beauty[1, 1]
beauty[1, 2]
```


# base R vs. stringr

- identify match to a pattern: `grep(..., value = FALSE)`, `grepl()`, `stringr::str_detect()`
- extract match to a pattern: `grep(..., value = TRUE)`, `stringr::str_extract()`,  `stringr::str_extract_all()`
- locate pattern within a string`regexpr()`, `gregexpr()`,  `stringr::str_locate()`, `string::str_locate_all()`
- replace a pattern: `sub()`, `gsub()`, `stringr::str_replace()`, `stringr::str_replace_all()`
- split a string using a pattern: `strsplit()`, `stringr::str_split()`

# How many times do the main characters speak?

```{r}
# person vector
beauty$person[1:5]

sum(str_count(beauty$person, "GASTON")) # using stringr
sum(grepl("GASTON", beauty$person)) # using base R
```

# How many characters did each character speak?

```{r}
beauty$line[str_detect(beauty$person, "GASTON")] %>% 
  nchar %>% sum
```

# Question 1
Make a data frame with three colums:

- character
- total number of lines spoken
- total number of characters spoken

What is the standard deviation of the number of characters spoken by each character? What is the max number of lines spoken by a character?


# A few points on general regular expression logic:

- $[\ldots]$ matches any of the items in brackets

- place the **frequency quantifiers after the items** they refer to. See the references for information on frequency quantifiers, which give constraints on how many times the pattern can be matched

- Use **parentheses for grouping patterns,** typically to give specific quantifiers or to control order of operations. You can do more with parentheses, as we'll see in the next section. For example `pl?ot` will match `pot` or `plot` but `(pl)?ot` matches `plot`, `lot`, `pot` or `ot`

- `expression1|expression2` matches `expression1 OR expression2.`

- `expression1expression2` matches `expression1 AND expression2` in the order given.





# Extraction
A quick example on that last point to demonstrate a string extraction using pattern matching.

```{r, eval=F}
str_extract_all("TOWNFOLK2 townfolk!", "[A-Z]+[0-9]+|[a-z]+[[:punct:]]+")
str_extract_all("TOWNFOLK2 townfolk!", "([A-Z]+[0-9]+|[a-z]+)[[:punct:]]+")
str_extract_all("TOWNFOLK2 townfolk!", "[A-Z]+([0-9]+|[a-z]+[[:punct:]]+)")
```


# Matches capital letters AND subsequent numbers OR lower case letters AND subsequent punctuation
```{r, echo=TRUE}
str_extract_all("TOWNFOLK2 townfolk!", "[A-Z]+[0-9]+|[a-z]+[[:punct:]]+")
```


# Matches (capitals AND numbers OR lower case) AND punctuation

```{r}
str_extract_all("TOWNFOLK2 townfolk!", "([A-Z]+[0-9]+|[a-z]+)[[:punct:]]+")
```

# Matches capitals AND (numbers OR lower case AND punctuation)
```{r}
str_extract_all("TOWNFOLK2 townfolk!", "[A-Z]+([0-9]+|[a-z]+[[:punct:]]+)")
```


# Replacement

```{r}
str_replace_all(beauty$person, "TOWNSFOLK[0-9\\s]*", "townsfolk")
```


# Putting it all together


```{r, results='hide'}
beauty$person <- str_replace_all(beauty$person, "TOWNSFOLK[0-9\\s]*", "townsfolk") %>%
  str_replace_all("CRONY[0-9\\s]*|CRONIES|OLD CRONIES", "crony") %>%
  str_replace_all("WOMAN[0-9\\s]*|BIMBETTES?[0-9\\s]*", "woman") %>%
  str_replace_all("MAN[0-9\\s]*|MEN", "man") %>%
  str_replace_all("GROUP[0-9\\s]*|ALL|BOTH|CHORUS|OBJECTS|BYSTANDERS|MUGS|MOB", "group") %>%
  tolower
```

# line counts
```{r}

group_by(beauty, person) %>% 
  summarise(N = sum(nchar(line))) %>%
  arrange(desc(N)) %>% slice(1:10) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = person, y = N)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=75, vjust=0.5, size=10), axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

# Clean the raw data

```{r}
# read the raw data in
beauty <- read_lines('http://www.fpx.de/fp/Disney/Scripts/BeautyAndTheBeast.txt')
typeof(beauty)
```


# Goal

A data frame with one row per line of dialogue with a column for the dialogue text and a column for the speaker name.


# The plan

- **collapse** the entire script into a single string

- **extract** each new line of dialogue as its own cell in a vector using the distinct structure of the dialogue identifiers

- **clean up** little issues along the way


# Collapse

```{r}

# collapse each line into a single string
# separate lines by a ;
beauty <- beauty%>% 
           str_trim(side = "both") %>% 
           paste(collapse = ";")

typeof(beauty)

# To avoid annoying issues later, since we don't try to distinguish individuals in group dialogue
beauty <- str_replace(beauty, " \\(ex. COGSWORTH\\):", ":") %>% str_replace(" \\(esp. LUMIERE\\):", ":")
```


# Step 2: Extraction, first try

We want a data frame with one column for the dialogue identifier (speaker name) and one for the line. Since every line starts with an identifier, we could try to:

- extract only the identifiers first 
- then extract everything between the identifiers

Won't work!

# look ahead/behind

- **positive look-ahead:** `pattern1(?=pattern2)` will match `pattern1` only when it is followed by `pattern2`
- **negative look-ahead:** `pattern1(?!pattern2)` will match `pattern1` when it is NOT followed by `pattern2`
- **positive and negative look-behinds** are similar, coded with `(?<=pattern2)pattern1` and `(?<!pattern2)pattern1` respectively

# test case
```{r}
test <- "I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night, but they said you'd make it worth my while. GASTON: It's like this.  I've got my heart set on marrying Belle, but she needs a little persuasion."
```


# look ahaed
```{r}
str_detect(c('candle!!?', 'candlemaker', 'smart candle%'), 'candle(?=[[:punct:]]+)')
```


# How do you extract everything before `GASTON:`

Use the catch-all *.* 
```{r}
str_extract(test, ".+(?=GASTON:)")
```

# maybe look-aheads can save us

```{r}
test <- "BEAST: What are you doing here? MAURICE: Run, Belle! BEAST: The master of this castle. BELLE: I've come for my father.  Please let him out!  Can't you see he's sick? BEAST: Then he shouldn't have trespassed here."

str_extract(test, ".+(?=[A-Z\\s[:punct:]]+:)")
```



# Didn't quite work...


- The function checks each character to see if it matches `.` (everything does) and is followed by the look-ahead expression.
- If both of those are true, it returns the match to the pattern we gave it before the look-ahead statement---in this case everything there is.
- When it got to the letter `S` in the last case of `BEAST:`, the look-ahead statement matched `T:` and returned everything else before it.



# A recap of the problem, and a fix

- person identifiers are not good string separation criteria
-  too much in common with the rest of the text

But the person identifiers are still distinct enough that we can match them---which means **we can replace them with identifiers that are different enough from the dialogue to be good split criteria.**



# add some bogus text

Extracting the person identifiers, adding some bogus lines to show this works for character names with punctuation and numbers:
```{r}
test <- "BEAST: What are you doing here? MAURICE: Run, Belle! BEAST: The master of this castle. BELLE: I've come for my father.  Please let him out!  Can't you see he's sick? BEAST: Then he shouldn't have trespassed here. TOWNSFOLK 2: He's a monster! MRS. POTTS: Now pipe down!"

str_extract_all(test, "[A-Z]+[\\s0-9[:punct:]]*:|MRS. POTTS:")
```

Replacing them:
```{r}
str_replace_all(test, "[A-Z]+[\\s0-9[:punct:]]*:|MRS. POTTS:", "&&&&&&&&")
```




# New plan

- **replace each character identifier with a unique id** that allows us to separate the text more easily using look-ahead expressions
- **extract the identifiers and the dialogue in between them,** giving two equal-length vectors matching speakers to what they say
- **create a data frame** with one column for speaker name and one for dialogue
- **match the ids back to the character names**

# see notes for the rest
