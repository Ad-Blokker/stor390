# Mueseum of Modern Art

- public data base: https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection

- **art dataset** has almost 130,000 records, one for each work

- **artist dataset** has one record per artist

see code at beginning of tidy_data notes

# Walk though tidying a data set
- see tidy data chapter in r4ds and tidy date notes for more details


# Look at raw data

see **moma_art_jan2017.csv** and **moma_artists_jan2017.csv** in github folder: https://github.com/idc9/stor390/tree/master/data

Why might these data files be hard to read in as .csv files?



# What do we want to know?

- Who is the **most prevalent** artist in the collection in terms of number of works?
- What is the **nationality distribution** i.e. artist nationality of works in the collection?
- Which artist has **the most diverse body of work** in terms of classifications? For example, we want to know which artist has the most number of works from different media, such as painting or photography.
- How do the classifications of pieces vary? **Is the MoMA mainly a painting museum or a sculpture museum or what?**
- Which **years of art** are the most represented?


# Tidy data
'Tidy' is shorthand for putting data into the best structure for analysis in *R.*

- Every observation has its own row.
- Every variable has its own column.
- Every cell has a single value.

![from R for Data Science textbook](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-1.png)

# What is a single observation?

- one obseveration per artist per work (i.e. work-artist pairs)
- could be different depending one the analysis

# First look in R

```{r}
str(art)
```


# Multiple entries in a cell

```{r}
select(art, constituentid, title) %>% slice(1109)
```

# Not tidy
- currently: row = one piece of art
- we want: row = artist-piece pair


# The plan
- `separate` the unique artist identifier, *constituentid*, into different columns so we have one value per cell

- `gather` the new id columns we just created into a  a **key-value** pair

- `unite` artist and work ids into a single column


# Work with a managable subset

```{r}
# get a small subset of the data to play with
# restrict ourselves to rows whose constituentid contains a comma
test <- filter(art, grepl(',', constituentid)) %>% 
            slice(10:50)
```


# First attempt
```{r}
separate(test, col = constituentid, into = c('artist1', 'artist2'), sep = ",")
```

# Why did this fail?
- only gave separate two destination columns
- some pieces have up to 31 artisits

```{r}
# find the largest number of collaborators on one piece
str_replace_all(art$constituentid, "[^,]", "") %>% nchar %>% max
```


# Try 2: add a ton of columns
```{r}
# how many columns to add
n <- str_replace_all(test$constituentid, "[^,]", "") %>% nchar %>% max + 1

# maybe this will work...
test <- separate(test, col = constituentid, into = paste0("artistid", c(1:n)), sep = ",", fill = "right")

# print out new artistid columns
select(test, contains("artistid"))
```

# Apply solution to entire data set

```{r}
# apply the solution to the full data set
n <- str_replace_all(art$constituentid, "[^,]", "") %>% nchar %>% max + 1
art <- separate(art, col = constituentid, into = paste0("artistid", c(1:n)), sep = ",", fill = "right")
```


# Key-value pairs

Gathering, as 'R for Data Science' puts it

- collects a set of column names and places them into a single “key” column. 

- collects the field of cells associated with those columns and places them into a single value column.

# Gather the artistid columns

```{r}
art <-gather(art, key = artistnum, value = constituentid, contains("artistid"), na.rm = TRUE)

select(art, artistnum, constituentid)
```



# unite the artist and art ids
```{r}
tidy_art <- unite(art, col = id, constituentid, objectid)

tidy_art %>% select(id)
```
