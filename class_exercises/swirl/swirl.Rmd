[swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) is an interactive R tutorial. Install and load the swirl package.

```{r swirl, eval=F}
install.packages('swirl')
library(swirl)
```

Once the swirl package has loaded you can get started by running
```{r start, eval=F}
swirl()
```

There are a few swirl courses. I suggest getting started with `R Programming` which comes preloaded. You can install other courses

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install_course("Exploratory_Data_Analysis")
install_course("Getting_and_Cleaning_Data")
install_course("Data_Analysis")
```
Once you have installed a course it should show up on the swirl dashboard.
