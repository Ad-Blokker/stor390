This lab will give you practice with 

- web scraping with the `rvest` package
- twitter's API with the `rtweet` package

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=F}
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
```

The lab is due: 

# **Q1: NYT**

Use the `rvest` package to get a list of all the story titles appearing on the NTY homepage: [https://www.nytimes.com/](https://www.nytimes.com/).


```{r, eval=F}

# some code to get articles titles
article_titles <-
    
# print out the first 10 titles so the grader can tell your code ran
article_titles[1:10]
```

# **Q2: twitter**
TODO: set parameters

Use the `rtweet` package to scrape twitter and answer the following question. How many of **USER**'s most recent **N** tweets mention the word **WORD**.
