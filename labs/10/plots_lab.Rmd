(Note: I'm not done writing the lab. I won't add more questions, but will flush out some details)

This lab asks you to think about effective visualizations. 

# Question 1: plots for communication


**1a**:  Take any plot that you made earlier this semester (even one that I made in a lecture) and turn it into a plot for communication (include the original plot as well).

**1b**: Explicitly state the message of the plot and the design choices you made to create the plot. How do the choices you made follow the principles of communication from lecture?


# Question 2: call BS

Link to a bad plot somone posted online and answer the following questions:

- What is the message of the plot?
- What is wrong with the plot?
- How would you improve the plot to better convey the message?

Any graphic you find is fine. Here are some places you might look
