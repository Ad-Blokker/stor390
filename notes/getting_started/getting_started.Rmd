# Install R

Download the latest version of R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (CRAN). [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a programming language built for statistical analysis.

# Install R Studio

Download [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) which is an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) built for R. While you can use R without R Studio, R Studio makes life much better.

# Basic R commands
You downloaded [base R](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf) from CRAN.

Run the following in your R console
```{r 11}
1 + 1
```

```{r var}
a <- 1
b <- 2
a + b
```

# Packages
The power of R comes from the many wonderful R packages people develope. R is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) language meaning anyone can develope a new R package. 

You can install a package from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) like this
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

There are other sources of R packags such as [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) and [Github](https://github.com/). Packages from CRAN and Bioconductor are vetted (though not perfectly). Packages on Github are not.

To use code from an R package you need to load it
```{r loadpackage}
# ignore the warnings for now
library(tidyverse)
```
You need to load an R package everytime you want to use it. You only need to install it once.

# IMBD
Load the [movies data set](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.html) generously currated by [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/)
```{r load movies}
load(url('https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.Rdata'))
```



The first thing you should do when you get a data set is [look at it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF8GhC-T_Mo). 

## numerical summaries

`head()` prints the first six rows of a data set (and as many columns that will fit on the screen)
```{r head}
head(movies)
```


If you double click a data frame it will pull up R's built in spreadsheet
![](spreadsheet.png)

`str()` gives a different view of the columns and includes some metadata
```{r str}
str(movies)
```

`summary()` prints out some descriptive statistics of each column
```{r summ}
summary(movies)
```

## Vizualization
You can only learn so much by looking a lists of numbers. Let's make some plots.

There are two popular plotting systmes in R. There is the *base* R system

```{r base_plot}
plot(movies$imdb_rating, movies$critics_score)
```

and [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/).

```{r ggplot}
# ggplot was loaded with tidyverse
ggplot(data = movies) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = imdb_rating, y = critics_score))
```

We will use ggplot2 in this course (see readings below about ggplot2 vs base). ggplot2 can be a bit intimidating at first -- especially if you are used to base plotting. 

```{r hist, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=movies, aes(x=audience_score)) + geom_histogram()
```

ggplot2 has a ton of functionality built it and you will learn to love it when you get used to it.

```{r byrating, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = movies) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = imdb_rating, y = critics_score, color=mpaa_rating))
```

# Getting help
The main textbook for this class is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) written by Hadley Whickham (it's free online). I have put up a long list of alternative resources (textbooks, coursera courses, etc) [HERE TOOD](). 

Google and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) will become your best friends. If you have a question, chances are someone has already asked and answered it. If R gives you an error message you don't understand google it -- someone else has probably figured it out and posted it online.

The course staff is of course here to help you. If you get stuck on something **spend at least 5 minutes Googling/hacking at it**. There is a good chance the first the one of us will do is turn to google. **Don't spend more than 20 minutes stuck on one thing** -- at this point you should as for help.

# Homework

## reading
- read the secions 1, 2, 3.1-3.5 of [r4ds](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
- read Jenny Bryan's tutorial on the [R workspace](http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html)
http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html

## coding
find and analyze a data set from [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/). See [TODO:]() for details
