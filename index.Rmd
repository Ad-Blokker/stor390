This course is an application-driven introduction to data science. Statistical and computational tools are valued throughout the modern workplace from Silicon Valley startups, to marine biology labs, to Wall Street firms. These tools require technical skills such as programming and statistics. They also require professional skills such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking.

You will learn these tools and hone these skills through hands-on experience working with datasets such as: Museum of Modern Art records, TCGA Gene Expressions and the text script of Beauty and the Beast. The first half of the semester will cover R programming skills. The second half will cover a number of topics: exploratory data analysis, web scraping, text processing, and effective visualization through a series of modules.
