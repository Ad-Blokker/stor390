This course is an application-driven introduction to data science. Statistical and computational tools are valued throughout the modern workplace from Silicon Valley startups, to marine biology labs, to Wall Street firms. These tools require technical skills such as programming and statistics. They also require professional skills such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking.

You will learn these tools and hone these skills through hands-on experience working with datasets such as: Museum of Modern Art records, TCGA Gene Expressions and the text script of Beauty and the Beast. The first half of the semester will cover R programming skills. The second half will cover a number of topics: exploratory data analysis, web scraping, text processing, and effective visualization through a series of modules.

- the datasets use in the class are on [data.world](https://data.world/iain/stor-390/) and [github](https://github.com/idc9/stor390/tree/master/data/)

- all of the course material is on the [github repo](https://github.com/idc9/stor390) including
    - [.Rmd files](https://github.com/idc9/stor390/tree/master/notes/) for the notes 
    - [example code](https://github.com/idc9/stor390/tree/master/example_code/) are also on github


- most of the course material is in the lecture notes (linked to above) and reading -- the slides are visual aids for the lectures.
